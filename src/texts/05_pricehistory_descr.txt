Further data optimization for dynamo DB.

For every item it **creates a json object which contains price history**. Price history has three subparts, c = currentPrice, o = originalPrice, d = date.
It lists last value of **commonPrice** as well as **minPrice**.

Due to price optimization it only saves changes (plus first date) in either current or original price.

It also fills in dates when there is no information (leaving them blank - so that it is not compact in the graph) and takes the minimum current price for an item in a day.
