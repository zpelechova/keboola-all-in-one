Further data optimization for dynamo DB.

For every item it **creates a json object which contains the primary key as md5 (shop & itemId) and price history**.

Price history has three subparts, c = currentPrice, o = originalPrice, d = date.

Due to price optimization it only saves changes (and first three and last date even if there is no change) in either current or original price.

It also fills in dates when there is no information (leaving them blank - so that it is not compact in the graph) and takes the minimum current price for an item in a day.
